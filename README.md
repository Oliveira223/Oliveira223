## üëã Hey there! Welcome to my space!

My name is Pedro H. N. Oliveira, a **Computer Engineering student**, a relentless explorer of how things work under the hood. I love digging into the core of systems, whether it's hardware, software, or that mysterious space where both collide.

### üöÄ What drives me?

- üñ•Ô∏è Low-level programming (Assembly, HDL, FPGA)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Embedded systems, microcontrollers, and digital design
- üèóÔ∏è Building things from scratch ‚Äî hardware, software, or both
- üìà Always hungry to **understand the full process**, from the blinking LED to the deep logic behind algorithms

### üîß Currently working with:

- üîå Digital logic, computer architecture, MIPS pipeline, finite state machines
- üî¢ Math meets engineering ‚Äî Calculus, numerical methods, and more
- üåê Web technologies for side projects (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)

### üß† Learning and sharpening:

- üöÄ HDL mastery (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
- üî¨ Embedded systems and microelectronics
- üî• Advanced computer architecture (pipeline hazards, CPI, datapath optimization)
- üéØ Algorithm design and optimization

### üí° Fun facts:

- üíÄ I fight bugs like a gladiator ‚Äî hardware or software, no mercy.
- üé∏ I play mandolin when my HDL code makes me question life choices.
- ‚è≥ Procrastination is real, but deadlines are the ultimate motivator.
