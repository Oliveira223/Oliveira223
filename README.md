## 👋 Hey! I'm a Computer Engineering student

🔧 I love understanding how things work — from bits to transistors.  
🛠️ FPGA, HDL, Assembly, Embedded Systems, and Digital Design.  
💡 Passionate about low-level stuff and making hardware come alive.  
🚀 Always building, learning, and breaking things (on purpose... sometimes).

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
